 The Odin Project - Google Homepage

Recently started with The Odin Project
This is my take at their first Project: designing the Google Homepage

to solve:
- weird border around searchbox 
- footer leaving space at the left

to add:
- icons inside searchbox (magnifying glass and voice search)
- hover over .svgs at the top (menu and user) needs shadow/frame
- tooltip texts on hover
