 The Odin Project - Google Homepage

Recently started with The Odin Project
This is my take at their first Project: designing the Google Homepage

update:
- border problem solved
- footer problem worked around by adding left: -5px; in css
- magnifying glass added, voice icon still missing

to solve:
- weird border around searchbox
- footer leaving space at the left

to add:
- icons inside searchbox (magnifying glass and voice search)
- hover over .svgs at the top (menu and user) needs shadow/frame
- tooltip texts on hover
